# Stock-Specific-LSTM
This is a basic LSTM application on stock (securities) market.

## What's LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)?
A popular LSTM introcution can be found at http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/. It said:
Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.1 They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.

LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!

## How does LSTM work?
There is a good Illustrated Guide to LSTM (https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21).

## Technically what's the difference?

## Is it practical?

Most code is copied from . What I did is as the following:

1. Stock specific preprocessing

2. Stock specific post LSTM

3. More comments
